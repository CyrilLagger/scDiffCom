scDiffCom stands for "single-cell Differential Communication" and infers 
changes in intercellular communication between two biological 
conditions from scRNA-seq data (as [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)
objects). The package relies on an internal collection of ligand-receptor 
interactions (available for human, mouse and rat) retrieved from seven 
curated databases.

## Installation

``` r
# We currently highly recommend to install the development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("CyrilLagger/scDiffCom")

# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("scDiffCom")
```

## Usage

As an introduction, please look at the
[documentation](https://cyrillagger.github.io/scDiffCom/) and this [vignette](https://cyrillagger.github.io/scDiffCom/articles/scDiffCom-vignette.html).

For a concrete and large-scale project that used scDiffCom, please look at
[scagecom.org](https://scagecom.org/), our murine atlas of
age-related changes in intercellular communication.
