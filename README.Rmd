scDiffCom infers cell type to cell type communication signals from 
scRNA-seq [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) objects,
and more particularly investigates how these interactions change between two biological 
conditions. The package relies on an internal collection of ligand-receptor
interactions (available for human, mouse and rat) retrieved from seven public
and curated databases.
