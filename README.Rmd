# scDiffCom

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of scDiffCom is to provides tools to investigate changes in intercellular 
communication between two conditions of interest in scRNA-seq datasets.

It relies on a curated collection of ligand-receptor interactions
(available for human and mouse) that have been retrieved and processed
from eight public databases.

Using as input a [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) object that should
contain cells annotated by cell-types and by two groups of interest
(e.g. young/old), the package infers cell-cell interactions that
potentially correspond to biological signals and significantly change between
the two conditions. For implementation details regarding the statistical
approach used in `scDiffCom` please see our (article in preparation). 

## Installation

You can install the released version of scDiffCom from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#(not available yet)
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CyrilLagger/scDiffCom")
```

## Typical workflow

For a usage example, please look at the vignette available
[here](https://cyrillagger.github.io/scDiffCom/articles/scDiffCom-vignette.html)
