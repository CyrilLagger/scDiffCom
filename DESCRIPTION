Description: The original purpose is to find age-related changes in intercellelular 
    communication based on scRNA-seq transcriptomic data. The package leverages
	several ligand-receptor databases and different computational methods in order
	to infer significant cell-cell interaction changes in a tissue of interest.
	The comparision is done between two conditions (e.g. young vs old).
