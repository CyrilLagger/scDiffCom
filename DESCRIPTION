Description: Analysis tools to investigate changes in intercellular
    communication from scRNA-seq data. Using a Seurat object as input,
    the package infers which cell-cell interactions are present in the dataset
    and how these interactions changes between two conditions of interest
    (e.g. young vs old). It relies on an internal database of ligand-receptor
    interactions (available for both human and mouse) that has been gathered
    from several published studies. The differential analysis relies on a 
    permutation test. The package also contains several tools to analyze and
    and visualize the results.
