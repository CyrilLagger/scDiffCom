scDiffCom infers cell type to cell type communication signals from
scRNA-seq [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) objects, and more
particularly investigates how these interactions change between two
biological conditions. The package relies on a internal collection of
ligand-receptor interactions (available for human and mouse) retrieved
from seven public and curated databases.
